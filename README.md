# üöÄ How It Works
The program takes a list of user comments.

Each comment is analyzed for presence of positive or negative keywords.

A sentiment tag is assigned to each comment.

A bar chart is generated showing the sentiment distribution.

# üìà Sample Output
Positive keywords: "amazing", "love", "good", "happy", "excellent", "best", ..."

Negative keywords: "bad", "worst", "poor", "waste", "disappoint", ..."

> The tool prints each comment with its sentiment and plots the sentiment counts.
